# Svelte apps async loading
Created with CodeSandbox

This demo was originally created by Maur√≠cio Kishi (https://github.com/mrkishi) as an aswer to a question asked at https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2760. Sandbox demo at https://codesandbox.io/s/3ulgy.

It explains very nice how Svelte apps are being loaded both via preload (so it works both client-side and during server-side rendering) and  at runtime.

Best!
