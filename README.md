# Sapper dynamic Svelte apps loading

This is an example of dynamically loading Svelte that are previously built in a separate step.

## 1. Original Sample

This demo was originally created by Maur√≠cio Kishi (https://github.com/mrkishi) as an aswer to a question asked at https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2760. His Sandbox demo can be found at https://codesandbox.io/s/3ulgy.

## 2. Svelte Template

The aim is to asynchronously load compiled Svelte applications without any prior knowledge. The applications are not be part of the Sapper project itself, but they're loaded from an external path instead. For this, we have copied the compiled Svelte apps - called "Hello Svelte" and "Hello World" - to the [Apps] folder in this repository. 

If you wish to create your own app (that can later be loaded in any kind of Svelte application), you can find more details here at [https://github.com/sveltejs/template].

## 3. Sapper Template

This repository is an updated version of the original [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) template. The idea is to dynamically load Svelte applications when navigating to a so called "Application Host" (that't just another page in the Sapper project).

To clone it and get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rzvdaniel/sapper-dynamic-import.git
cd sapper-dynamic-import
npm install # or yarn!
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and navigate Apps route in the Home page. From there, you have access to the two links that asynchronously load the two sample apps:

Each of the two links would direct you to the same page ([app].svelte) using two different route options:
- /app/bye-world
- /app/hello-world

Once the [app].svelte page is touched, the Svelte app corresponding to the route being accessed should be dynamically loaded at runtime.

Best!
